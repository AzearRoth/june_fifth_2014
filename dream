I dreamed I was hanging out with Rafi and his brother.  We did some stuff I can't remember.  And then, we parted ways.  He haded me some gold, and I put it
in my pocket.  When I went home, back to my home town, it felt like the gold had weighed me down.  So much so that I traveled back in time.  Like, time
had moved ahead of me, while I was walking back to my town.  And I ended up in the past.  

I remember feeling odd because I still had my intellect, but I was back in that time.  My body was younger.  I was younger.  But I still had my mind.  So,
I went to high school as was expected.  I knew what to do, how to stay hidden.  But there were those who wanted to hurt me.  I stayed quiet.  I stayed 
out of sight.

Later that day, I went to a family affair.  I think I just knew to go there, like it was something teenage me just had on my mind.  And so I went.
When I got there I felt awkward.  I hung up my coat.  Something important, I went there the same way I go to the library.  To the high school hang out.
There were actually people from that time, from levels at the event.  But I felt out of place.  Until my cusisans came in.  I spoke with them but we could
barely understand each other.  And they knew about the gold.  I felt embarrased about it.  I lied to them about having it.

They seemed concerned, like they knew.  Then I woke up.

I had a second dream.  This second dream was just an uplifting song that all of us sang.
